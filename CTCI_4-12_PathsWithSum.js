/* 
CTCI - 4.12 Paths with Sum
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. 
The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
