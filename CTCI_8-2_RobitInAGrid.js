CTCI - 8.2 Robot in a Grid 
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are 'off limits' such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.
