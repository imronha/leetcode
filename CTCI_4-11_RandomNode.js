/* 
CTCI - 4.11 Random Node
You are implementing a binary search tree class from scratch which, in addition to insert, find, and delete, has a method getRandomNode() which returns a random node from the tree.
All nodes should be equally likely to be chosen.
Design and implement an algorithm for getRandomNode, and explain how you would implement the rest of the methods.
