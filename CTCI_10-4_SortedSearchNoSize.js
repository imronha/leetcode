/* 
CTCI - 10.4 Sorted Search, No Size
You are given an array-like data structure Listy which lacks a size method. It does, however, have an elementAt(i) method that returns the element at index i an O(1) time. If i is beyong the bounds of the data structure, it returns -1. (For this reason, the data structure only supports positive integers). Given a Listy which contains sorted, positive integers, find the index at which an element x occurs. If x occurs multiple times, you may return any index
